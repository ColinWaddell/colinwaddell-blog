I'm constantly telling new (and old) developers the same things. As with any good ideas relating to software developement these are mostly copy+pasted from other places. It's nice to see them in the same place though.

Over time I hope to expand on why I think each of the following is as important.

 1. If you need to do something twice, automate it.

 2. Treat your future self as a psycho with a time machine who will punish you for your mistakes.

 3. The best code is the code you don't need to write.

 4. Commas and new lines are free.

 5. Don't risk optimising early.

 6. Readability wins over fancy, the compiler is smarter than you.
 
 7. Remove the human from the loop.
 
 8. When all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
 
 9. Software is never finished - only abandonned.

 10. Don't write "just in case I need it" code

 11. Work smarter, not harder.

 12. Code isn't written just for computers.
 
 13. A coding standard should never encourage delicate code.
