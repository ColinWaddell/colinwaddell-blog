# Impetus

It's funny how a silly idea can end up taking over your life.

Back in 2012 I was out walking the dog on an unseasonably warm day down the River Kelvin in Glasgow trying to think up a simple JavaScript project I could write to learn about Ajax transactions; a website which would pull data from an external source, do something with the data, and produce a result for the user.

Pretty generic idea right? That kind of describes every single website-as-a-service out there, however programming is an incredibly creative persuit so as dry as my remit sounded the execution could be as weird as I wanted.

# Nationally endorsed sun-stroke

There's an unagreeable temperature upon which Glaswegian's will deem it appropriate to start undressing in response to a lick of heat coming from the sky. Although no-one can settle upon when it's appropriate (some say never) what we can agree upon is the taxonomy of the conditions: it's Taps Aff weather.

Not that removing one's shirt under favorable atmospheric conditions is unique to the west-coast of Scotland, but the fervour with which locals descend upon every sun-licked park, patio and beer garden is a source of civic pride. This [could perhaps have something to do](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-sunniest-and-dullest-cities-in-europe/) with Glasgow receiving the fewest hours of sun per year than any other European city clocking in at an average total of 1202 hours. Even Reykjavik in Iceland pulls in more with 1268 hours per year and it's a _bawhair_ off being in the arctic circle.

This phrase Taps Aff has therefore come to embody far more than just paradoxical undressing. It represents shucking your responsibilties in favour of topping up your vitamin-D, meeting with friends under the sun and making the most of what little good weather we get.

# So when is it Taps Aff?

Since its inception the website has been through 3 phases, each time getting better at identifying when it's Taps Aff:

 1. Client-side JS driven version
 2. A [KissMVC](https://github.com/erickoh/KISSMVC) PHP server-side implementation
 3. The current version implemented using Django

## Version 1

At first the website would just look at the current temperature in Glasgow, including wind-chill. I very scientifically pulled the threshold of 17°C out of my arse and had the site say Taps Aff if the local temperature was greater, Taps Oan if it was lower. By this point I figured I was done and I had learnt all I needed about Ajax and Json. That was until I started getting hundreds of visitors per day.

Here's the guts of the very first version of the site written using JQuery. Note that all the weather data I retrieved was in Fahrenheit so the actual threshold was 62°F

{% highlight javascript %}
var url = "http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20weather.forecast%20where%20location%3D%22UKXX0061%22&format=json";

function TapsAff()
{
    $("#dynamic-taps-message").html("aff");
    $("#dynamic-taps-message").css("color","#FF5454");
}

function TapsOan()
{
    $("#dynamic-taps-message").html("oan");
    $("#dynamic-taps-message").css("color","#2A44F0");    
}

function TapsError()
{
    $("#dynamic-taps-message").html(" error");
}

$(document).ready(function(){
    var Result = $.getJSON(url, "",
        function (data)
        {
            temp_f = data.query.results.channel.wind.chill;
            if (!isNaN(temp_f))
                if(temp_f>63) TapsAff();
                else TapsOan();
            else TapsError();
        })
        .error(TapsError);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Being a coder I'm by defacto full of hubris so the thought of hundreds of people visiting something I'd made but had put minimal effort into appalled me. I done the only logical thing: purchased the domain [taps-aff.co.uk](https://taps-aff.co.uk/) and started working on a server-side version.

![An example friendly email](/media/taps-aff-email.png)

## Version 2

[Version #2](https://github.com/ColinWaddell/tapsaff) of the site gave me a chance to learn more about using an [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) paradigm whilst structuring a project. I had some website work using [Zend](https://www.zend.com/) coming up so I figured learning a lighter PHP framework would be a good stepping stone. The first release of this server-side version was quickly put together and deployed.

Anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing one of their personal projects take off in popularity understands the praise-to-critisim ratio. By the time version #2 of the site was flying around the internet I was getting thousands of hits per day and only the negative feedback seemed to register. This was almost always to do with the site giving its opinion on the weather and the general public disagreeing.

### Version 2.5

It was important to make the site smarter so I started diving deeper into the weather data I was receiving when making a judgement. I was now considering the 47 individual weather codes available along with the time the sun would rise and set. Not only that but I was now allowing people to search the weather anywhere in the UK.

{% highlight php %}
// List of codes of non-aff weather
$GLOBALS['terrible_weather'] = array(
    0,   // tornado
    1,   // tropical storm
    2,   // hurricane
    3,   // severe thunderstorms
    4,   // thunderstorms
    5,   // mixed rain and snow
    6,   // mixed rain and sleet
    7,   // mixed snow and sleet
    8,   // freezing drizzle
    9,   // drizzle
    10,  // freezing rain
    11,  // showers
    12,  // showers
    13,  // snow flurries
    14,  // light snow showers
    15,  // blowing snow
    16,  // snow
    17,  // hail
    18,  // sleet
    19,  // dust
    20,  // foggy
    21,  // haze
    22,  // smoky
    25,  // cold
    35,  // mixed rain and hail
    36,  // hot
    37,  // isolated thunderstorms
    38,  // scattered thunderstorms
    39,  // scattered thunderstorms
    40,  // scattered showers
    41,  // heavy snow
    42,  // scattered snow showers
    43,  // heavy snow
    45,  // thundershowers
    46,  // snow showers
    47  // isolated thundershowers
);
{% endhighlight %}

This incarnation of the site stood for a few years and has served the most amount of traffic over the site's life. However I was still getting beef off people for the site not being accurate enough, on top of that people were after forecasts, maps, [API](https://taps-aff.co.uk/api/Glasgow/) data and to be honest I wasn't too happy having to keep feeding the [feature creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) in a programming language I wasn't interested in.

## Version 3

A complete rewrite of the site would give me the chance to reinvent the Tap and build something I'd be happy to support and work on continuously. Professionally I'm a digital engineer in the space industry working full-stack all the way from designing sensors and circuits all the way up to customer portals. On of the pieces of technology I had been using almost daily for a couple of years was [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), the Python Web framework. I could also bring in a lot of other tools I've been using to speed up the developement cycle.

In the end I settled upon:

 - Base framework would be Django and would be isolated using [virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)
 - I'd use Bootstrap 4 for the frontend
 - Heavy use of [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) to automate my most common build and deployment tasks
 - [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) for CI
 - There'd be no JS on the site

As far as I was concerned though the best thing about moving to this structure is that Django will automatically build me an administrative interface for the website allowing me to easily tweak settings whilst on-the-go. No longer would the temperature thresholds be baked into the code, instead they'd be held in a database available for tweaking at any time!

The flexability of this configuration would also give me far more fidelity when deciding whether it was Aff or Oan weather outside. Each of those 47 types of weather mentioned earlier could be individually tweaked: 17°C may make sense (to me) on a still clear day, but what if it's a little cloudy out there?

![The admin interface](/media/taps-aff-admin.png)

And what about all those missing features people were after? By rebuilding the site in a more familiar framework everything seemed possible. Maps? No bother. API? Piece of piss. Forecasting? Don't sweat it.

In the end the rebuild and implementation of new features only took a couple of weeks and was totally worth it.

The core of whether it's Taps Aff [now looks like](https://github.com/ColinWaddell/TapsAff-Django/blob/master/www/taps/forecast.py#L54):

{% highlight python %}

def _test_taps_aff(code, temp_f, daytime):
    """
    Return the current status of the weather

    Arguments:
    code -- Weather code returned by Yahoo API
    temp_f -- Current temperature with windchill
    daytime -- Are we between the hours the sun is up?
    """
    taps = {
        'status': OAN,
        'message': ""
    }

    if not Weather.objects.filter(code=code, terrible=True) and daytime:
        delta = Weather.objects.get(code=code).delta
        theshold = CONFIG().threshold + delta
        if temp_f >= theshold:
            taps["status"] = AFF

        elif temp_f + CONFIG().delta > theshold:
            taps["message"] = "...but only by a bawhair!"
    
    return taps

{% endhighlight %}

[The source code for the current version of Taps Aff is available here](https://github.com/ColinWaddell/TapsAff-Django)

# Where does all this weather data come from?

Since its inception I've been using Yahoo's free weather service to provide realtime status information along with future forecasting and location services (i.e. converting searched postcodes to placenames). Recently they updated their service so you need to have a whitelisted application in order to retrieve data from them. [I've documented the move to this service here]({% post_url 2019-03-06-yahoo-weather-example %}) along with any sample code you might need to do the same.

To keep in Yahoo's goodbooks I heavily cache requests so that I don't loose access to their free service. I've never made a penny off this site and don't plan on it, so there's no chance I could move over to a paid-for weather serice. For the amount of traffic [taps-aff.co.uk](https://taps-aff.co.uk/) receives I'd have to pay the likes of [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/) thousands of pounds per year... although being able to do hourly forecasting would be super cool!

# Afterthoughts

This website has been a really weird part of my life for ages now.

I've had job interviews whether the employer has been more interesting talking about how I parse the weather outside rather than the work at hand. I've been in meetings where people have started talking about the site in front of me with no idea that I'm behind it. I have even went to start writing [python libraries](https://pypi.org/project/tapsaff/) and [Alexa skills](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neil-Stewart-Taps-Aff/dp/B01N0MYYF5) to interface with the [API](https://taps-aff.co.uk/api/Glasgow/) and discovered someone's beat me to it.

There's a whole bunch of things I'd like to get to over time. It should be noted though that as much fun as the site is the goal has always remained the same and any future developments are there as as part of a learning sandbox for myself. I think over time I would like to investigate:

 - Operating the site as an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/faqs/) instance with Zappa
 - Getting [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) involved
 - Finish the cross-platofrm app [I started developing](https://github.com/ColinWaddell/TapApp) (just got push notifications to implement and it's done!)
 - Varying the threshold as the year progresses. Peoples willingness to go Taps Aff in April happens at a much lower temperature than in August.

Most of all I can't fucking believe this is what I'm now an expert in. I'm always reminded of this joke:

> A man goes into a pub in a small town and, for whatever reason, gets introduced to the clientele. There’s Farmer Jack, Barman Jim, Maurice "Dancer" and Sheepshagger John. After a few pints, the visitor’s curiosity gets the better of him and he asks John what’s with the nickname.
> 
> "See this pub?" asks John, "I built it, but they don’t call me Pubbuilder John? I’m the local doctor, I saved Barman Jim’s life once when he choked on a peanut, but they don’t call me Lifesaver John. Every year, I supply a huge Christmas tree for the village green, but the don’t call me Christmas Tree John.
> 
> "But you shag one lousy sheep…"
